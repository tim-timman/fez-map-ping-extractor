# Fez Map Ping Extractor

Extracts ones (chime with ping) and zeros (chime without ping) from an audio recording of the Fez map.


## How to use

Requires python 3 (only tested with 3.9)

1. Create a python environment  
   ```sh
   python3.9 -m venv --upgrade-deps venv
   ```
2. Activate the environment  
   ```sh
   source venv/bin/activate      # linux/mac
   source venv/Scripts/Activate  # Windows
   ```
3. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements
   ```
4. Run it
   ```sh
   python map-ping-extractor.py <path-to-file>
   ```

## Audio capture

Due to being on a Mac and not being able to easil record playback audio for more
than 20 min without purchasing software for $124 ([loopback][loopback]). I opted
for recoding it with a microphone out of the speaker. The noise introduced I could
work around with the code.

[loopback]: https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/

Room background sounds are also played in the map. I chose to stand in Ladder
Tower room (one with the treasure chest at the top) because the background sounds
in that room are quite quiet and low frequency. This meant I could easily filter
that out when coding to automatically extract the chime and ping. Music was obviously
turned off.

When in the map I navigated a bit away from the current room node chime to quiet
it (since it is direction) to make the sourceless ping more prominent in volume
compared to it. This might not have be necessary.


## Extracted data

I have recorded a bit over an hour, and extracted it to the following bits.

`0`s are the current room node chimes without a ping, and `1`s where the ping was present.  
*Note!* I've grouped 64 bits per line for no other reason than of readability.

## Analysis and conclusion

I tried looking at the intervals between ones, but it was anything between 0 and
108 chimes. I've been expecting 64 to be the biggest coherent unit (if there was one)
due to the relevance in the game, but with that variability there would be no way of
grouping (that I can see) where there's a lot of nothing.

Thus far it seems random. It doesn't match up with any of my previous 15-20 min
recordings. And if this was to be a message to decode, there should be some way
of knowing when the message is over and repeated, which I can't find. Expecting
that window to be more than the hour I've checked makes me think there isn't
anything here. Oh, well.

Also the point that [someone remembered][qa] at the map was added as a QA request.
That along with the seeming lack of reference to the map within the game.
